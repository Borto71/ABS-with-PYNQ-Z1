# **ABS-with-PYNQ-Z1**
This project implements an **Anti-lock Braking System** (ABS) on the **PYNQ-Z1** FPGA development board. The ABS logic is written in Verilog and synthesized using Xilinx Vivado. The final bitstream is generated and deployed through the Vivado design suite.

## **GOAL OF THE PROJECT**
The goal of this project was to design an ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) in Verilog, simulate it, and test its functionality.
